        Why is exercise important for our body?<br>
        Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance. 
        Exercise sends oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently.
         And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores.

               We have all heard it many times before -- regular exercise is good for you, and it can help you manage your weight. But if you are like many Americans, you are busy, you sit most of the day at your job, and you haven't yet changed your exercise habits. The good news is that it's never too late to start. You can start slowly, and find ways to fit more physical activity into your life. To get the most benefit, you should try to get the recommended amount of physical activity for your age. If you can do that, the payoff is that you will feel better,
                may help prevent or control many diseases, and will likely even live longer.
